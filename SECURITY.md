# Security Policy
If you've found a critical security issue, you can report it in the 'Security' tab of this repository.

## Supported Versions
I try to keep as much versions as safe as possible, but it is always handy to get the latest version.
See below for the supported versions.
Before you report a vulnerability, please check your version.

```currently, there are no published versions```

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter a issue with the privacy and safety of users, report it in the 'Security' tab.
All issues will be taken seriously and will be looked at. If possible, the issue should be fixed in the newest version.
